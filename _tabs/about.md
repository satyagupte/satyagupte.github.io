Hi! I am Satyajit Gupte and this is my personal blog where I occasionally ramble about Machine Learning Systems.

My interests are in designing ML systems and understanding how they fit into the overall scheme of things. I used to work on Ads relevance at Pinterest and on e-commerce recommendations and search in an earlier life. I once built a [ML model](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tZiMXH4AAAAJ&hl=en) that helps you dress well despite having a wardrobe limited to track pants.

I also love to [travel](https://threebearstravel.com/) !

You can reach me at gupte.satyajit@gmail.com or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyajit-gupte/).

Thanks for stopping by !
